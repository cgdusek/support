# Privacy Policy — Vista Server

Vista Server respects your privacy.

Vista Server is designed to operate entirely on your local computer and local network. It does not rely on cloud services, external servers, or third-party analytics.

## Data Collection

Vista Server does **not** collect, store, or transmit personal information.

- No user accounts are required
- No analytics or telemetry are collected
- No advertising or tracking technologies are used

---

## Video and File Access

- Vista Server only accesses the folder you explicitly select.
- Access to this folder is managed using macOS security-scoped permissions.
- No other files or folders on your computer are accessed.

Video files remain on your computer at all times.

## Network Communication

- Vista Server runs a lightweight local HTTP server.
- Network communication occurs only between Vista Server and Vista on devices you choose.
- All communication stays on your local network.
- No data is transmitted to the internet or external services.

If authentication is enabled, access tokens are used only to authorize local connections.

---

## Third Parties

Vista Server does not share data with third parties.

No third-party services, SDKs, or APIs are used for data collection or tracking.

---

## User Control

You are always in control of:
- Which folder is shared
- Whether the server is running
- Whether authentication is enabled

Stopping the server immediately ends all network access.

## Changes to This Policy

This privacy policy may be updated as Vista Server evolves. Any changes will be reflected in this file.
